Additionally, UPF ratings may become more standardized, making it easier for consumers to choose hats based on reliable protection.</li> <li><strong>Global Health Movements:</strong> As more countries push for skin cancer prevention and overall health, global demand for UPF sun hats is expected to rise. This will be particularly noticeable in regions with growing middle-class populations and increasing access to health and lifestyle education.</li> <li><strong>Personalization and Customization:</strong> With the rise of direct-to-consumer retail models and online customization, consumers will seek more personalized sun hat designs.
